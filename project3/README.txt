CS315 DSA Project 3 Phase one 


1.The print function I wrote was taken form the lectrue last week but was modified to meet the needs of reading a Json file.
  Same goes with the eof() function.


2.I did not provide code to any student in the class.

3.I have implemented all the features in this project to read a json file.
